Scrum is apparently the solution to all the world problems /s  
Feedback should be given generously, but this is difficult. Receiving feedback
is also very difficult, as it's very easy to become defensive, and not accept
the feedback (Which is a of-cause a waste of time).

## Lean development

* Eliminate waste
  * Don't do unnecessary work, such as bureaucracy
  * Don't leave things unfinished. Either remove them, or finish it
  * Remove idle time
* Amplify learning
* Decide as late as possible
* Deliver as fast as possible
* Empower the team
* Build integrity in (Perceived and conceptual quality)
* See the whole

## Testing

Completely randomized design
> Randomized grouping for all people, so the same amount of people are in all groups
Randomized block design
> People are split based on a block variable, then randomly assigned to groups within those blocks
Matches pairs design
> Same experimental units
>> Let all units get the same treatments, in random order, and compare results for each unit
> Similar experimental units
>> Take similar units, and let each unit take the treatment once, then compare the results for each pair
