Why did we do waterfall? Came from original engineering approaches. 

Switch to agile to get quicker feedback, and ensure correct product.

Turns out the estimates are almost always wrong, and have a tendency to get even worse,
if the communication part of the product creation fails.

Main reason for doing DevOps is to reduce the cycle time of a product, that is
the time it takes for the product to go from "We need to do this thing" to
"The customer can now do the thing, and want these changes".

Lots of tiny things go into this, but the main way to rule them all, is
to have machines do all the heavy lifting, aka automating everything.
This way it makes it easier to have fewer errors e.g. in configuration, and
makes it easier to do new releases, so they are not as stressed, as they can
sometimes tend to be.

Break the walls between development and operations, as it is a shared effort in the
end, not just something that is being thrown over the wall.
